# Semidefinite Lift-and-Project relaxations for Stable Set and Graph Coloring Problems
SDP formulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This software package includes python scripts for formulating Lov&aacute;sz and Schrijver's [1] Lift-and-Project SDP relaxations. In particular this project focus on two fundamental Combinatorial Optimization problems:

 * The Maximum Stable Set Problem (MSSP)
 * The Graph Coloring Problem (GCP)
